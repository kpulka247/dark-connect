## Overview

This is a simple browser extension designed to turn the Garmin Connect website into dark mode. Frustrated by the lack of a dark mode feature on Garmin Connect, I created this extension to enhance the browsing experience for users who prefer a darker interface, especially during nighttime use. The extension is lightweight, easy to install, and only affects the Garmin Connect page, leaving all other websites untouched.

## Features

- **Dark mode for Garmin Connect**: Instantly changes the theme of the Garmin Connect website to dark mode.
- **Preserved brand colors**: Retains the original colors of key elements, such as charts and recognizable brand features, while switching the background and other components to dark mode.
- **No impact on other websites**: The extension only affects `connect.garmin.com`, other pages remain unaffected.
